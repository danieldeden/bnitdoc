# Bnitdoc

This is Bnitdoc, a tool built on [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) designed to make developer documentation more accessible by presenting all documentation from multiple different projects in the same place.

Easy access to documentation from multiple different projects can serve as good inspiration and a way to share knowledge gained from different projects, which can apply to the project that you're working on.
